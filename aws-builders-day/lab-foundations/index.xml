      <description>Objectives Let’s look into an interesting use case and see how you can create static websites without any servers. You can launch instances using AWS EC2 service, or AWS LighSail service, and we leave it to you to launch VM instances in the cloud. Amazon S3 can also be used for this purpose.
Services Used in this Lab:  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.</description>

      <description>Objectives Let’s look into creating virtual data centers in the cloud. This exercise guides you through the steps to create a nondefault VPC with a public subnet, and to launch an instance into your subnet.
This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you&amp;rsquo;d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
Services Used in this Lab:  *Virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.</description>

      <title>Create a MySQL Relational DB in minutes</title>

      <description>Objectives In this tutorial, you will learn how to create an environment to run your MySQL database, connect to the database, and delete the DB instance. We will do this using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business.</description>

      <title>Create a NoSQL DB in minutes</title>
      <link>http://example.org/lab-foundations/managed-nosql-db/</link>

      <description>Objectives Let&amp;rsquo;s create a NoSQL DB without server to manage and that can scale to tens of thosands of read/write requests per second. Instead of using the AWS Management Console, you will use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to manage DynamoDB auto scaling.
Services Used in this Lab:  Amazon DynamoDB: Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.  It&amp;rsquo;s a fully managed, multiregion, multimaster database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.</description>
