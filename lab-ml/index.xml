      <description>Objectives Create an IoT thing and start communicating with it.
Services Used in this Lab:  AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT Core can support billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely. With AWS IoT Core, your applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices, all the time, even when they arenâ€™t connected.</description>

      <description>Objectives You willork with neural networks to build a model that will be able to recognize hand written digits.
Services Used in this Lab:  *Amazon SageMaker: * Amazon SageMaker provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly. Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that covers the entire machine learning workflow to label and prepare your data, choose an algorithm, train the algorithm, tune and optimize it for deployment, make predictions, and take action.</description>
